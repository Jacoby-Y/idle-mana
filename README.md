## Story
You come from a family of merchants, but you've always wanted to be a wizard. But, not just any ol wizard, you of course want to be the best wizard. Because... why not? Alas, you only have enough mana energy to cast simple spells (compared to the professionals). Then you started to wonder, why not get others to do my work for me? Spoken like a true merchant. And so, adventure awaits you, wizard! Renounce your capitalist ways, summon hordes of minions, and become a great user of majik! (because "magic" is too boring)
