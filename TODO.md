# Story Boarding Outer Game Loop
You get there by buying the "Quantum Manifester".
Once you have it, you can go to another page and start using it
it uses mana to run and starts generating stock. 
You can sell your stock to get WizoCoins (Majikoins?) and buy upgrades
These upgrades include, but are not limited to:
- Storage majik (More max stock)
- ... (Less mana per manifest)
- Overclocking (Faster manifesting)
- Advertising (faster stock purchasing)
- Company Growth (larger target market) 

Random events? (idk, some loser said something like "Manafestival")
